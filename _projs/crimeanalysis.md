# Using Visualization and Data Mining Tools for Crime Data Analysis

<img src="/assets/images/thumbs/mskde_sibgrapi_2016.png" style="width: 100%;border:1px solid grey"/>

In this project we are integrating Visualization and Data Mining Tools to analyze crime data.

The first technique we developed in the project is MSKDE - Marching Squares Kernel Density Estimation. It generates fast and accurate hotspot maps. MSKDE is described in the [paper](/publications/mskde-using-marching-squares-to-quickly-make-high-quality/) published in SIBGRAPI.
