## Abstract
Social networks provide a rich source of opinionated content, which may give an insight on how customers
are reacting to a company’s service. An interesting application in this sense is to analyze customer feedback on social media to prioritize service or response times to customers in critical situations or to the most unsatisﬁed. In this work, we present a deep learning approach using LSTM networks applied to the sentiment analysis of tweets, aiming customer service prioritization through the introduction of a new class to help characterize the level of dissatisfaction with the service provided, as well as a comparative study with more traditional machine learning approaches.
