## Abstract
Provenance (also referred to as audit trail, lineage, and pedigree)
captures information about the steps used to generate a given data
product. Such information provides documentation that is key to
determining data quality and authorship, and necessary for preserving,
reproducing, sharing and publishing the data.  Workflow design, in
particular for exploratory tasks (e.g., creating a visualization,
mining a data set), requires an involved, trial-and-error process. To
solve a problem, a user has to iteratively refine a workflow to
experiment with different techniques and try different parameter
values, as she formulates and test hypotheses. The maintenance of
detailed provenance (or history) of this process has many benefits
that go beyond documentation and result reproducibility. Notably, it
supports several operations that facilitate exploration, including the
ability to return to a previous workflow version in an intuitive way,
to undo bad changes, to compare different workflows, and to be
reminded of the actions that led to a particular result.

As provenance-enabled systems are deployed, and increasing volumes of
provenance information are collected, there is a unique opportunity to
leverage and obtain useful knowledge from this data. In this paper, we
take a first step at analyzing this data. We present a preliminary
analysis of workflow evolution provenance generated by thirty subjects
who worked on six distinct exploratory tasks over the period of four
months. This initial analysis shows that useful statistics can be
extracted from this data that provide insights into how different
people interact with workflow systems to solve problems.
