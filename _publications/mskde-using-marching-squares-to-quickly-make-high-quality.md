## Abstract

In recent years, violence has considerably increased
in the world. In a certain state of Brazil, for example, the
homicide rate grew from 16 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants
in 2000, to 48 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2014. Police
departments worldwide use various types of crime maps, which
are generated with diverse techniques, in order to analyze and
fight crime. Those types of maps enable decision makers to
identify high-risk areas and to allocate resources more effectively.
Hotspot maps, in particular, are crime maps often available
in visual interactive systems for crime analysis. In order for
hotspot maps to be really useful, they need to be very accurate -
specially for resource allocation tasks - and to be processed very
fast for quick analysis of different scenarios. In this paper, we
propose MSKDE - Marching Squares Kernel Density Estimation,
a solution for generating fast and accurate hotspot maps. We
describe the technique and demonstrate its superior qualities
through a careful comparison with the standard Kernel Density
Estimation technique, which is widely used for generating hotspot
maps.
