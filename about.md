        <p>I am a Computer Science student at the <a href="http://www.ufc.br">Federal University of Ceara</a>, in Brazil. I'm currently in my final semester and intending to enter the job market. I'm a versatile programmer who can quickly learn a language or tool, but I tend to focus on back-end development and data science and analysis</p>
        
        <p>I also work at the <a href="http://www.lsbd.ufc.br/">Systems and Databases Laboratory</a> as an intern, where I've published papers in the field of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p>

        <p>During my university years, I've done a one year exchange in France, at the university <a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/">ENSIMAG</a>. There, I've also worked an internship at Michelin, where I wrote my thesis, named Applications of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Support Projects on Augmented Workers.</p>

        <p>I'll continue to study and develop myself in the hopes of gathering as much experience as possible, and to hone my skills so that I can always stand proud of them. </p>
