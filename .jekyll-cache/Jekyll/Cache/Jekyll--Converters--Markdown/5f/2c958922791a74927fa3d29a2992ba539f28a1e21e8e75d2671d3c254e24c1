        <p>I am a Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College London</a>, currently undertaking a 3-year Ph.D. program. In my research, I explore the quality of references in large knowledge graphs such as <a href="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>, through a mixture of statistics, crowdsourcing and machine learning. I am currently finishing my first year and moving on to tackle further issues such as reference verifiability automation.</p>
        <p>I also work at the <a href="http://cleopatra-project.eu/">CLEOPATRA project</a> as an Early Stage Researcher. The CLEOPATRA project (a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network) offers a unique interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral research and training programme, which explores how we can begin to analyse and understand how the major events that influence and shape our lives and societies play out online.</p>
        <p>I am a Summa Cum Laude graduate from the <a href="http://www.ufc.br">Federal University of Ceara</a>, in Brazil. My formation is as a data scientist and analyst who loves to extract insightful information from data. I have also partaken in an exchange to France, at the <a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/">ENSIMAG</a> grande école. There, I worked on pattern recognition, machine learning techniques and distributed systems. My graduation thesis, named Applications of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Support Projects on Augmented Workers, explored how Artificial Intelligence can be used to help human workers improve their levels of productivity when carrying tasks which can be partially automated by machines, and how to unite both.</p>
        <p>I have experience working for companies as a Data Scientist and as a member of R&amp;D departments. I have previously worked for multinationals in the fields of energy production and manufacturing, as well as for university laboratories as Research Assistant.</p>
