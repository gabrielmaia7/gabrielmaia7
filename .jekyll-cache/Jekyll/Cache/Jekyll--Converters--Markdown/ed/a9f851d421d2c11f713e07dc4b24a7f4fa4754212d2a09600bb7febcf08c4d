        <p>I am a Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College London</a>, currently undertaking a 3-year Ph.D. program. Before this, I graduated Summa Cum Laude at the <a href="http://www.ufc.br">Federal University of Ceara</a>, in Brazil. I'm a data scientist and analyst who loves to extract insightful information from data.</p>        
        <p>I also work at the <a href="http://cleopatra-project.eu/">CLEOPATRA project</a> as an Early Stage Researcher. The CLEOPATRA project (a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network) offers a unique interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral research and training programme, which will explore how we can begin to analyse and understand how the major events that influence and shape our lives and societies play out online.</p>
        <p>During my university years, I've done a one year exchange in France, at the <a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/">ENSIMAG</a> grande école. There, I've also worked an internship at Michelin, where I wrote my thesis, named Applications of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Support Projects on Augmented Workers.</p>
