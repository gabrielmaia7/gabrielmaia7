        <p>I am a Computer Science student at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">King's College London</a>, currently undertaking a 3-year Ph.D. program. Before this, I graduated Summa Cum Laude at the <a href="http://www.ufc.br">Federal University of Ceara</a>, in Brazil. I'm a data scientist and analyst who loves to extract insightful information from data.</p>
        
        <p>I also work at the <a href="http://cleopatra-project.eu/">Cleopatra project</a> as an Early Stage Researcher. </p>

        <p>During my university years, I've done a one year exchange in France, at the university <a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/">ENSIMAG</a>. There, I've also worked an internship at Michelin, where I wrote my thesis, named Applications of Deep Learning Neural Networks to Support Projects on Augmented Workers.</p>

        <p>I'll continue to study and develop myself in the hopes of gathering as much experience as possible, and to hone my skills so that I can always stand proud of them. </p>
